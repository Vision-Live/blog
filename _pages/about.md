I have worked at a senior level in housing for over 25 years including 10 years as Chief Executive of ‘TPAS’ and 2 years as Executive Director of Tenant Services at the Regulator of Social Housing where I authored the then consumer standards. I currently work as an independent consultant specialising in tenant scrutiny and involvement and as a non-executive in housing and health, including being Chair of ‘Healthwatch Salford’ and the Vice Chair of the Guinness Partnership Board.
